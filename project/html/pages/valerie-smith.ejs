        <p>
            On Monday April 27th 2020, we spoke with Valerie Smith. Valerie is an Interfaith Reverend-in-training, a
            certified Death Doula, and the creator behind Your Neighborhood Death Doula, an audio guide to death and
            grieving in isolation and pandemic â€” with weekly talks, meditations, art and writing prompts, rituals,
            poetry,
            and questions for navigating loss during Covid-19.
