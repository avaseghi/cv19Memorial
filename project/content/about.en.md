# About

## Team

cv19memorial is a digital and transnational space to share experiences of loss during COVID-19. In a time marked by physical distance, we're exploring ways of expressing pain through personal testimony. We invite you to add words, photos, mementos on grief and witness others' contributions. Our team recognizes that this crisis does not affect all equally and is made worse for many through systemic inequality. We hope you will trust our commitment to representing your stories.

### Our Values
Access to the means to mourn while physically distant 
Representation of the stories behind the statistics
Transnationalism and solidarity during a shared trauma
Collectivity of healing through transcultural observance
Honesty in the portrayal of a crisis that has unequally impacted people
Justice for the deceased and their families

### Who We Are
We are a team of activists, artists, designers and researchers committed to human rights defense and with ample experience in the development of memorials, participatory processes and interactive platforms. We live in Mexico, the UK, Canada and the USA. We are also people like you, deeply affected and grieving during the COVID-19 crisis who care about telling this story.

## Community Advisory Board
The cv19memorial Community Advisory Board is a transnational group of people who have submitted testimony to the memorial and wanted to become further involved. Our first group of advisors are those who submitted testimonies in the first phase and were invited to participate on a voluntary basis. The group advises the memorial, informing decisions in the realms of platform design, communications, etc. Exact board roles and terms are currently in formation. 

Information about individual Community Advisory Board members and further ways to get involved are coming soon.

### Partnerships
We are invested in growing a community of human rights defenders, activists, media partners, initiatives and artists, among many others, to amplify and strengthen cv19memorial’s mission. If you are interested in joining our effort to provide a space for collective mourning & witnessing of testimonies, please reach out at info@cv19memorial.org
